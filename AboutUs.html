        <h2>What is pâtisserie?</h2> 
        <font>
            Pâtisserie is used to describe French pastries and the pastry shop they are 
            sold in. Although the word is used quite liberally in English-speaking countries,
            in France and Belgium the law restricts its use to bakeries who employ licensed 
            maître pâtissier (master pastry chefs).Specialty Coffee We proudly serve Caffe Vita’s 
            delicious coffee blends and single origins. They are pioneers in the Farm Direct
            movement where coffees are sourced directly from farmers that are committed to 
            sustainable practices. All coffees are roasted to order and delivered weekly by
            our Brooklyn based roaster.</font>
